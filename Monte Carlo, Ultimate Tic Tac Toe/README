Assignment 3: MCTS: Tic-Tac-Toe

ucb1 is our heuristic modification of mcts_vanilla. It allows the traverse_nodes method
to choose the next move based on a factor of exploration and exploitation as opposed to
a random function.
The exploration and exploitation factor returned from hcb1 takes into account how far down
the tree has been explored, favoring unexplored leaves higher in the tree over high win count
nodes farther down.
