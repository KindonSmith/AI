Assignment 3: MCTS: Tic-Tac-Toe
Analysis of Experiment 2:

mcts_modified always beat mcts_vanilla, unless it has a singificantly smaller search tree
size. When mcts_modified plays against vanilla, it has a higher win rate when mcts_modified
has a higher search tree than vanilla. It still wins on equal search tree sizes, but
there is a noticeable increase.
