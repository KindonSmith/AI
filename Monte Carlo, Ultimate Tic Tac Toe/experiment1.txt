Kindon Smith and Riley Honbo
Assignment 3: MCTS: Tic-Tac-Toe

Analysis of Experiment 1:

When vanilla bot plays against itself, the score is close to a 50-50 win ratio.
There wasn't any ties, but a fair score between both players. The tree size
didn't seem to matter all that much, both bots had fairly equal scores
because each bot searched the same amount.
We had one outlier at the 75 node count, however it is within an acceptable range
considering that outputs with both higher and lower node counts tended towards 50%.
